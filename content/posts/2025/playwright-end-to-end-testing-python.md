## Introduction

Playwright is an open-source automation library developed by Microsoft for testing web applications. It enables reliable end-to-end testing across modern browsers with a single API. The Python version supports **Chromium**, **Firefox**, and **WebKit**, making it a robust alternative to Selenium or other legacy tools.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Headless & Headed Modes**: Run tests in both modes.
- **Auto-Waiting**: Built-in waiting mechanisms before element actions.
- **Network Interception**: Mock or modify network traffic.
- **Async and Sync APIs**: Choose between synchronous or asynchronous coding styles.

## Installation

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

## Basic Test Example

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_homepage():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("https://playwright.dev/")
        assert "Playwright" in page.title()
        page.click("text=Get started")
        assert "intro" in page.url
        browser.close()

test_homepage()
```

## Pytest

For pytest integration:

```bash
pip install pytest-playwright
pytest
```

## Debugging

- Use `page.pause()` to launch the inspector:

```python
page.pause()
```

- Run tests with debugging enabled:

```bash
PWDEBUG=1 pytest
```

## CI Integration

Playwright works well in CI environments. Example GitHub Actions snippet:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install playwright
    playwright install
- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: pytest
```

## Conclusion

Playwright for Python brings the power and reliability of modern browser automation to Python developers. Its flexibility, ease of use, and cross-browser support make it ideal for E2E testing.
